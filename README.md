## Synopsis

This program generates a tree of smaller matrices that illustrate how the determinant of a Matrix is calculated

## Motivation

* I sought a visual interpretation of the formula for the calculation of the determinant

This program does not attempt to provide any geometric intuition for the determinant. However, there are some relations between the determinant and area and volume which could be explored.

## Installation

Download and install Processing from http://www.processing.org.
